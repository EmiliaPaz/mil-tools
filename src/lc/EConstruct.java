   * Search for and report failures for "ambiguous" type variables in the types of identifiers that
   * are part of this AST node. A type variable is considered ambiguous if there is no way to
   * determine how it should be instantiated in any given use. The input argument specifies the list
   * of all generic type variables that appear in the type of the enclosing binding (whose
   * instantiation will be determined by the context in which the bound variable is used) as a
   * prefix of all of the "fixed" type variables (i.e., those that appear free in the environment,
   * and hence cannot be freely instantiated). Any type variables that do not appear in this list
   * may be considered ambiguous. Ambiguity arises in examples like "length Nil" where there is no
   * way to determine the type of the "Nil" list. Occurrences of ambiguous type variables must be
   * fixed by rewriting the code (for this example, "length Nil" is an unnecessarily complicated way
   * of writing "0") or by adding type information.
